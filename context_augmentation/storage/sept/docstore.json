TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a\ntechnology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connects\nconsumers (\u201cRider(s)\u201d) with independent providers of ride services (\u201cMobility Driver(s)\u201d) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers\n(\u201cEaters\u201d) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, \u201cMerchants\u201d) with delivery service providers (\u201cCouriers\u201d) for meal preparation, grocery and\nother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to\nas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product\nexpertise to connect shippers (\u201cShipper(s)\u201d) with carriers (\u201cCarrier(s)\u201d) in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment,\ntransportation management and other logistics services. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nOur technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia\n(excluding China and Southeast Asia).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in\nthe United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) regarding interim financial reporting. The\ncondensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date.\nCertain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted\npursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The\nresults for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.\nIn the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the\nfinancial position, results of operations, comprehensive loss, cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.\nThere have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 filed\nwith the SEC on February 24, 2022 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and\nvoting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities for further information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.

Mobility revenue also includes immaterial revenue\nstreams such as our financial partnerships products.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nDelivery Revenue\nWe derive revenue for Delivery from Merchants\u2019 and Couriers\u2019 use of the Delivery platform and related service to facilitate and complete Delivery\ntransactions.\nAdditionally, in certain markets where we are responsible for delivery services, delivery fees charged to end-users are also included in revenue, while\npayments to Couriers in exchange for delivery services are recognized in cost of revenue. In these markets, we recognized revenue from end-users of $228 million\nand $490 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and revenue from end-users of $349 million and $934 million for the three\nand nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively. We also recognized cost of revenue for these delivery transactions, exclusive of depreciation and\namortization of $642 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and cost of revenue of $1.0 billion and $2.7\nbillion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, respectively.\nDelivery also includes advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising services.\nFreight Revenue\nFreight revenue consists of revenue from freight transportation services provided to Shippers. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition\nof Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2\ninstrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using\nmarket observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are valued based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted\nmarket prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of\ncommon stock investments, preferred stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held\ncompanies without readily determinable fair values.\nDepending on the investee\u2019s financing activity in a reporting period, management\u2019s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee\u2019s\nfinancing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the\nenterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by\nusing other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market\ndata of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee\u2019s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in\nthis valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.\nOnce the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (\u201cOPM\u201d), a common stock equivalent (\u201cCSE\u201d) method or a hybrid approach is\nemployed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the\ninvestees\u2019 expected time to liquidity and volatility.\nAn increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could\nresult in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and\nvolatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee\u2019s financing transactions. In the\nfuture, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity on a specific identification method.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30,\n2022, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNon-marketable Equity Securities Note Receivables MLU B.V.

The carrying value of our non-\nmarketable equity securities are adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer (referred to as the\nmeasurement alternative) or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated\nstatement of operations. Certain non-marketable equity securities are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the fair value of these\nsecurities based on\n16", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4951, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15d5a687-bea8-41bb-ba05-69f6c5e24d0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "15d5a687-bea8-41bb-ba05-69f6c5e24d0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30c67104-0da9-496c-8679-47e3094a6358", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "802b93921f5da794dc76774ac0b6f95f64b04fc3f662bbf24d0dbe9f491834ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7e5ce2d-2bb5-48bb-a23b-3f332c05bef9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "531442265db89c34d174cc0c9ff3cfb94450aa5efe0cf63af9725e50f0046dcf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "21900e07-0d84-4a3a-baaa-fe01dae5164b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "36f9630efcb9c9b51a6f040531c825711c75e2a1da48fab01b21e7b7efbb3601", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "154ef2a831338144c3d6dc11bdcb6403fef9313629fe1a273f09190fed9e406e", "text": "valuation methods, including the CSE and OPM methods, using the transaction price of similar securities issued by the investee adjusted for contractual rights and\nobligations of the securities we hold.\nDidi Investment\nIn the second quarter of 2022, Didi completed their delisting from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE Delisting\u201d).

During the first quarter\nof 2022, we determined that our investment in MLU B.V. was other-than-temporarily impaired, and recorded an impairment charge of $182 million in other income\n(expense), net in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The impairment was primarily due to consensus projections of a protracted recession of the\nRussian economy as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To determine the fair value of our investment in MLU B.V., we utilized a market approach referencing\nrevenue multiples from publicly traded peer companies.\nMLU B.V. Basis Difference\nIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionate share\nof the net assets of MLU B.V.

Therefore,\nthe 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.\nThe initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately\n$80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special\ninterest.\nUpon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and\nshares of our common stock, at our election. We may not redeem the notes prior to December 20, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at\nour option, on or after December 20, 2023 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at\nleast 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and\nincluding, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount\nof the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nThe indenture governing the 2025 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the\nincurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2020-06, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Convertible Notes were allocated between the conversion feature recorded\nas equity and the liability for the notes themselves. The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liability\ncomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equity\ncomponent of the 2025 Convertible Notes was included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and was not\nremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes as\nof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.\nEffective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease to\nadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to the\nopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021, interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 Convertible\nNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.\nThe fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $955 million as of September 30, 2022 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.\nSenior Notes\nThe 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries.\nThe indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well\nas certain financial covenants specified in the indentures.

The primary differences between the effective\ntax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the deferred U.S. taxes related to our investments in Aurora, Grab, and Didi, the valuation allowance on our\nU.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and foreign tax rate differences.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $247 million, none of which would impact the\neffective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various states, and foreign\ntax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For\nour major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2004 through 2022 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, the United Kingdom\n(\u201cUK\u201d), and Australia.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, we do not expect any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits\nwithin the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are unable to estimate the\nfull range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits.\nIn the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d), our ability to utilize net operating\nlosses, tax credits, and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through September 30,\n2022. Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nNote 10 \u2013 Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net\nloss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible\nsecurities is reflected in diluted net loss per share by application of the treasury stock method or if-converted method, as applicable.\nWe take into account the effect on consolidated net loss per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using\nthe equity method.\n26",

operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating\ndecisions and evaluates operating performance.\nOur three operating and reportable segments are as follows:\nSegmentDescription\nMobility Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,\nmotorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products.\nDelivery Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or\nhave the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as\nwell as select other goods.\nFreight Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a\nshipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.\nFor information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 \u2013\nRevenue.\nOur segment operating performance measure is segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and,\naccordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue,\noperations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment\nAdjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations (as shown in the table\nbelow).

Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may\nchange.\nOn September 27, 2021, Aleka Insurance, Inc., our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, entered into a Loss Portfolio Transfer Reinsurance\nAgreement (the \u201cLPTA\u201d) with James River Group companies (\u201cJames River\u201d) effective July 1, 2021. Pursuant to the LPTA, our captive insurance subsidiary\nreinsured certain automobile liability insurance risks relating to activity on our platform between 2013 and 2019 in exchange for payment by James River to our\ncaptive insurance subsidiary of a premium in the amount of $345 million (\u201cPremium\u201d). Subsequent to the LPTA, we retain substantially all of the liabilities on\nthese policies when taken together with previous risk transfer arrangements. In connection with the LPTA, claims currently administered by James River were\ntransferred to a third-party claims administrator for ongoing handling (the \u201cTransferred Claims\u201d) at our expense. The liabilities associated with the Transferred\nClaims were re-evaluated as of September 30, 2021, and adverse development was recognized on certain of those liabilities. During the third quarter of 2021, we\nrecognized a $103 million charge in our condensed consolidated statement of operations consisting of the difference between the Premium and the assumed\nliabilities (including the cost of future claims administration), expenses associated with the LPTA, and the adverse development on the Transferred Claims.\nNote 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2021 and\nSeptember 30, 2022, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $2.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.\nWe are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent\ncontractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair\ncompetition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\u201cTCPA\u201d)\nclaims, Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.\nWe have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit\nproceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California\nState Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of\nmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or\nrange of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of\noperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters\nwere resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially\nadversely affected.\nDriver Classification\nCalifornia Attorney General Lawsuit\nIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\n\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018.

The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court\u2019s ruling, and we filed a\npetition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November\n2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5\u2019s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.\nProposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of\nthe passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to\ncomply with the provisions of Proposition 22.

On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit\nremains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. We have petitioned to stay this matter\npending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. Since the assignment of the\ncoordination judge, the case remains stayed as to discovery. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.

The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the\nAlameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal.

The complaint alleges Drivers\nare employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. The complaint was served on July 20, 2020 and Uber filed a motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint on September 24, 2020, which was denied on March 25, 2021. A summary judgment motion was filed in September 2021, and we filed a motion in\nwhich we argue that the motion is premature. The court granted our motion to defer the summary judgment motion on January 12, 2022 and summary judgment\npapers will be fully briefed by May 31, 2023. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be\nestimated.\nSwiss Social Security Rulings\nSeveral Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber\nB.V. for social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.\nIn April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and\nRasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2019. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App\nin 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal\nTribunal and has no impact on our current operations. On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the canton of\nGeneva are classified as employees of Uber B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH.\nFollowing this ruling, we received a request for information from the SVA Z\u00fcrich that states that Couriers shall be considered employees for social security\npurposes since the launch of Uber Eats.

The\ntribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that Drivers were workers whenever our App is switched on and they are ready and able to take trips based on an assessment of\nthe App in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at\nthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment law\npurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing.\nOn March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when driving\nwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlement\nprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register for a settlement\nof historical holiday pay and national minimum wage liabilities closed on July 22, 2021 and we have extended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are\nnot already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers. Compensation hearings will take place for claimants who\nhave not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time, expenses, and holiday pay.\n30", "start_char_idx": 3557, "end_char_idx": 6045, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2836a5a-2ab5-41f8-b118-362de5650a37": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2836a5a-2ab5-41f8-b118-362de5650a37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f023a9b-6218-4176-9d7c-daf614e423ff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "e387555e7f7266865062aa9792f3a9f2392da57336cc147f75e0ad20d2577cf9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26840b48-04f4-4ba1-aae6-e0b3298fd74e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "62e68d8d4e729068e6e772f657ab3b7ab93b76a7f4df0e7e4fa6090c9c92fa13", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29c614f2-3cec-47bb-a664-f0645c48b03a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "28262e39d4fc680704b448553971528574b17616b52e14b409adf7074e3cf98b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "4333d29a93077f837ac5aa3788580a22bad5ed38ad47a75cad617fc4e4f99cbc", "text": "On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation.

Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from\n2014 through 2018. The NJDOL has provided several assessments from February through October 2021. We have submitted payment for the principal revised\namount of the assessment and have since reached agreement on the remaining amounts allegedly owed from 2014 through 2018.\nThe NJDOL has expressed its intention to audit later years.

Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could\nnegatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational\nactivities and procedures.\nIndemnifications\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions,\nwe may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain\nrepresentations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former\nemployees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss\nunder these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.\nNote 13 \u2013 Variable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support.\nConsolidated VIEs\nWe consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary.

Transfer of the assets and operations of Careem Qatar will\nbe subject to a delayed closing pending timing of regulatory approval. We have rights to all residual interests in the Careem Qatar entity which is considered a\nvariable interest.

Refer to Note 15 \u2013 Business Combination for further information.\nNote 15 \u2013 Business Combination\nCornershop\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest (or 47%, on a fully-diluted basis) in Cornershop in an all-stock\ntransaction. As consideration for our acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest, we issued 25 million shares of our common stock, including 4.6 million\nrestricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees. In addition, we issued 4 million stock options to replace assumed outstanding stock options. These\nreplacement stock options attributable to post-acquisition service were included in our option activity and were recognized as stock-based compensation expense.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain\nor loss in our condensed consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2021. In connection with this acquisition, the\npreviously recognized non-controlling interest was derecognized. Following this transaction, Cornershop became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nThe total purchase price was determined to be $967 million, based on the number of shares issued and Uber\u2019s share price on the closing date. The fair value of\nthe 4.6 million restricted shares issued to certain Cornershop employees was determined to be $202 million. These shares are restricted and contingent on the\nemployees\u2019 continuing employment at the combined company for three years, beginning in August 2021. These restricted shares are considered compensation for\npost-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense ratably over three years, beginning in August 2021.\nNote 16 \u2013 Divestiture\nDivestiture of ATG Business to Aurora\nOn January 19, 2021, we completed the previously announced sale of our ATG Business, a subsidiary focused on the development and commercialization of\nautonomous vehicle technology, to Aurora. As a result, our controlling interest and the non-controlling interests in the ATG Business were settled, and ownership of\nthe ATG Business transferred to Aurora.\nAs consideration for the sale, Aurora issued Series U-1 preferred shares to the third-party investors of the ATG Business to settle their ATG Series A Stated\nLiquidation Preference of $1.1 billion, which had previously been recorded as redeemable and non-redeemable non-controlling interests on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet prior to this transaction. We received the residual consideration from the sale as the only common unit holder of the ATG Business in the\nform of Aurora common shares valued at $1.3 billion, representing 22% of fully-diluted (25% undiluted) ownership interest of Aurora. Concurrently, we invested\n$400 million in Aurora in exchange for Aurora Series U-2 convertible preferred shares, representing 4% of fully-diluted (5% undiluted) ownership interest of\nAurora.\nWe do not consolidate Aurora under either the VIE or the voting interest model.\nWe entered into a commercial agreement with Aurora pursuant to which the parties will collaborate with best efforts to launch and commercialize self-driving\nvehicles on our ridesharing network. We also allowed unvested RSUs for Uber stock held by employees of the ATG Business that transferred to Aurora to continue\nto vest over the next 12 months contingent upon the employee remaining at Aurora. As a result, we initially recognized liabilities of $315 million as consideration\nfor these future obligations to Aurora.\nThe sale of the ATG Business did not represent a strategic shift that would have had a major effect on our operations and financial results, and therefore does\nnot qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. Our ATG Business was included in the ATG and Other Technology Programs segment prior to this transaction.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, results of ATG and Other Technology Programs are included within All Other.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated\nfinancial statements included in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion\ncontains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-\nlooking statements. You should review the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d for a discussion of forward-looking statements\nand Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the\nforward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A\nto point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of\nride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public\ntransportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight\nindustry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies\nthat provide new solutions to everyday problems.\nDriver Classification Developments\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,\n2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco\nSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the\nalleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.\nOn August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violating\nvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply with\nthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use\nplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s\npreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date of\nProposition 22.\nIn January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,\nwhich was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California\nCourt of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument has yet to be\nscheduled in that matter.\nTo comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings\nfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results\nof operations, financial position, or cash flows.\nAlso of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

Any of these events could negatively impact our business, result of\noperations, financial position, and cash flows.\nFor a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating\ncondition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled \u201c-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees\u201d\nincluded in Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and Note 12 \u2013 Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of\nrevenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates\u201d and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(In millions, except per centages) 2021 2022 % Change% Change\n(Constant Currency )\nMonthly Active Platform Consumers (\u201cMAPCs\u201d) 109 124 14 %\nTrips 1,641 1,953 19 %\nGross Bookings $ 23,113 $ 29,119 26 % 32 %\nRevenue $ 4,845 $ 8,343 72 % 81 %\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. $ (2,424)$ (1,206) 50 %\nMobility Adjusted EBITDA $ 544 $ 898 65 %\nDelivery Adjusted EBITDA $ (12)$ 181 **\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 8 $ 516 **\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2021 2022 % Change\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (338)$ 886 **\nFree cash flow $ (556)$ 693 **\n See the section titled \u201cReconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\n See the section titled \u201cCertain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\n Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. included stock-based compensation expense of $281 million and $482 million in the third quarter of 2021\nand 2022, respectively.\nNet cash used in operating activities and free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected a $1.0 billion cash inflow related to a\nlegacy auto insurance transfer.

Freight Gross Bookings grew 335% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily attributable to the\nacquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in the fourth quarter of 2021. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 13% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis,\nprimarily driven by growth in the US & Canada.\nRevenue was $8.3 billion, up 72% year-over-year. Revenue growth outpaced Gross Bookings growth primarily due to a $1.3 billion increase in our Freight\nbusiness, primarily due to the acquisition of Transplace during the fourth quarter of 2021, and the net favorable impact to Mobility revenue of $1.1 billion as a\nresult of business model changes in the UK.\nNet loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $1.2 billion, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity\nsecurities, net of $550 million primarily related to changes in the fair value of our marketable equity securities, including: a $641 million loss on our Didi\ninvestments, partially offset by a $90 million gain on our Aurora investment. Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. also includes $482 million of stock-\nbased compensation expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $516 million, up $508 million compared to the same period in 2021. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit was $898 million, up $354\nmillion compared to the same period in 2021. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $181 million, up $193 million from an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $12 million\nin the same period in 2021.\nWe ended the quarter with $4.9 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nOther Developments\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 had rapidly changed market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Various governmental restrictions, including the declaration of a federal National Emergency,\nmultiple cities\u2019 and states\u2019 declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public\ngatherings, and other measures have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations. For example, we temporarily suspended our\nshared rides offering globally, and recently re-launched our shared rides offering in certain regions, and continue to offer \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for\nDelivery offerings. We also responded to COVID-19 by launching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related\nto delivery of food and other goods.\nFurthermore, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, Driver supply constraints.

We have concluded that we are an agent in these\narrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver\nincentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal or grocery delivery service.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and, as a result, concluded we are responsible for the provision of mobility\nservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, end-users are our customers and our sole performance obligation in the\ntransaction is to provide transportation services to the end-user. We recognize revenue when a trip is complete. In these markets where we are responsible for\nmobility services, we present revenue from end-users on a gross basis, as we control the service provided by Drivers to end-users, while payments to Drivers in\nexchange for mobility services are recognized in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nFor additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition,\u201d \u201cNote 1 - Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue\nRecognition,\u201d and \u201cNote 2 - Revenue\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2021 and Note 2 \u2013 Revenue in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, credit\ncard processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation\nservices, amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses as well as costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are\nprimarily responsible for mobility or delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services.\nWe expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip\nvolume changes on the platform. As Trips increase or decrease, we expect related changes for insurance costs, credit card processing fees, hosting and co-located\ndata center expenses, maps license fees, and other cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nOperations and Support\nOperations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in\ncities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer\nsupport, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19 and Trip volume increases, we would expect operations and support expenses to increase on an\nabsolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, advertising\ncosts, product marketing costs and discounts, loyalty programs, promotions, refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers, and the allocation of\ncertain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.\nAs our business recovers from the impacts of COVID-19, we would anticipate sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis for the\nforeseeable future but vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and\nproduct development. Expenses include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We\nexpense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.\nWe expect research and development expenses to increase and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and\ndevelopment activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs, offset by a\ndecrease in investments in our ATG and Other Technology Programs subsequent to the sale of our ATG Business in 2021.\n38", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5133, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edbdb3ff-ca2c-4c69-85d8-5e257654f0d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "edbdb3ff-ca2c-4c69-85d8-5e257654f0d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b8da8e5e-ea50-4484-8fff-840242183b4a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "e7c6d86c70d6b331c187b950b8dbc68f2e336c42b52f54144b5faaba8c9f236e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7be0805f-8e90-4f4c-8e6c-09fb734a27ec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "39", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "f11b622bf9210ad26785f9820e4fc84b8edb78e0c4ce13765d38fe11064514b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "972133b1-62fd-4278-b202-f63d63f3bb90", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6c7e401569e644ee2587782a1ecd8095da75e3872530133f6b86fbaea72d91d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "27c9291f6f6f3f86cef04d8aeaf10cbd2c235ef7a410906e60db569feffe032b", "text": "General and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and\nadministrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as\nallocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs.

These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management\u2019s internal comparisons to our historical\nperformance. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key\nmetrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help\nthem analyze the health of our business.

The preparation of these condensed\nconsolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and\nrelated disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We\nevaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences\nbetween these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nFor additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note\n1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,\nItem 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 \u2013 Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency\nrisk as follows:\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The\n2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact\nour condensed consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100\nbasis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nThe fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining\nin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $239 million\nas of September 30, 2022.\nInvestment Risk\nOur investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash\nequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.8 billion and $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2022, respectively. We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market\nfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk.\nChanges in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in\ninterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and\nrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value\ngiven the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4855, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de46d3e6-d467-4414-ba62-011ef15e3af0": {"__data__": {"id_": "de46d3e6-d467-4414-ba62-011ef15e3af0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d1dcf879-aeef-4b3f-9497-a2c839122c26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "9db2ae531e99e7c951bebf211262bad00adb26530a410be5b9ace541b92cb65d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b16ecae3-a4e6-49da-b293-2ddd75fcbb46", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "4258b0edb92f716df7ccc9c619e2097baa7a58c832cdd3ed8cb1490a15fa7a19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "967859fd-00b8-4ebf-90fe-a1f1f98083d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c31676adab688efa4299b0c59088efd13a02cc123be06ef912056fc0ff9b957", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cb9641ad48ab2a099c60273d806c670eefc93677dcfabe825796fcfde7b2801c", "text": "We\ndid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of September 30, 2022.

Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to\nthe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating\nexpenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating\nresults as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified\nacross geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement\nof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency\nrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into\nderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we\nfile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time\nperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule\n13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe acquired Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) in November 2021. As part of our ongoing evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting, we are\nreviewing the internal controls of Transplace and are making appropriate changes as we deem necessary. Other than the controls related to Transplace, there were\nno changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our\nmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.\nAny control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its\nobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the\nperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The\nclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of\ncertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We deny\nthese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nWhile it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the\nmatters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be\nmaterial to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal\nproceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related\nto the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where\nwe may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in\nwhich we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government\ninvestigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and\ninterim rulings.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following\nrisks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-\nLooking Statements\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and the related\nnotes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and\nmay lose all or part of your investment.\nOperational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nOur business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.\nThe classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are\ninvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before\nadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as\nworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because,\namong other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, and\nprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification\nof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.\nIn addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file)\narbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual\nsettlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $477 million as of September 30, 2022. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal\nproceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively\nimpact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.\nChanges to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent\ncontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of\nDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have\nbrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.\nIn November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like\nours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent\ncontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be\nfiled.\nWe face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,\nalleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we\nmay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ededdbae-6453-4edd-b506-f97f4051a76f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ededdbae-6453-4edd-b506-f97f4051a76f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0abb2bb-55bf-4152-8c2c-58e78d7fdf92", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "1ecde974c651ee8fb28d44e495cc600d965c60e82f58e30c9ed49cd36cbf5df0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a976e935-5318-4aee-bb7b-7446a3d58fc3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "8d7cdcd9eda8ebea3d8bdf391933ed533b232d8e466762df7130a152b6287e21", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b337423-2cf4-492f-b7b8-a7f2e725564e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9e66f1bd052ed93a10a4cc9c742a7910e6ac4fd4be9eb2971606dd7b32e4af5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a208de3cb5ba14bd33354a6e9659271dd8562fa20daf55d668bede99c2b664ae", "text": "Although our stipulation to\ndissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating\nto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22.

Uber B.V., et al. ruling by the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (rather\nthan self-employed). Subsequent to the UK Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we announced that we will treat all UK drivers as \u201cworkers\u201d under UK labor law, going\nforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paid\nholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a\ndriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French\nSupreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status),\ndecisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent\nSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are\nemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.\nIn addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers\nbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of\nDrivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt\nour operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.\nIn addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation\nincluding revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled \u201cCritical\nAccounting Estimates\u201d included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low\nbarriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these\nindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.\nOur platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are\nhighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and\nCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers\nto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to\nshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other\nmerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of\norders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.\nFurther, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a\nlimited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than\nwe do.

These investments or strategic\ntransactions, along with other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to compete more effectively against us and continue to lower\ntheir prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to their\nplatform and away from ours. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower fares or service fees or maintain or increase our Driver incentives and\nconsumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relatively nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will\nstabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase\nsignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception. We incurred operating losses of $4.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2021, and as of September 30, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $33.4 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease\nproportionate expenses in future periods to achieve profitability in many of our largest markets, including in the United States, and even if we do, we may not be\nable to maintain or increase profitability. We may continue to incur losses in the near term as a result of substantial increases in our operating expenses, as we\ncontinue to invest in order to: increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform through incentives, discounts, and\npromotions; expand within existing or into new markets; increase our research and development expenses; expand marketing channels and operations; hire\nadditional employees; and add new products and offerings to our platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in\nincreasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these expenses. Many of our efforts to generate revenue are new and unproven, and any failure to adequately increase\nrevenue or contain the related costs could prevent us from attaining or increasing profitability. In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect to\nadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate. Further, we charge a lower\nservice fee to certain of our largest chain restaurant partners on our Delivery offering to grow the number of Delivery consumers, which may at times result in a\nnegative take rate with respect to those transactions after considering amounts collected from consumers and paid to Drivers. As we expand our offerings to\nadditional cities, our offerings in these cities may be less profitable than the markets in which we currently operate. As such, we may not be able to achieve or\nmaintain profitability in the near term, in accordance with our expectations, or at all. Additionally, we may not realize the operating efficiencies we expect to\nachieve as a result of our acquisition of Careem, Postmates or other acquired companies, and may continue to incur significant operating losses in the United\nStates, Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan in the future. Even if we do experience operating efficiencies, our operating results may not improve, at least in the\nnear term.\nIf we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or\nother factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users, and our financial results would be adversely impacted.\nOur success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to maintain or increase our network scale and liquidity in that geographic market\nby attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform.

We also take certain measures to protect against fraud, help increase safety, and prevent privacy and security\nbreaches, including terminating access to our platform for users with low ratings or reported incidents, and imposing certain qualifications for Drivers and\nmerchants, which may damage our relationships with platform users or discourage or diminish their use of our platform. Further, we are investing in our\nautonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers.

Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it\ndifficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny,\nand results in additional litigation and governmental investigations. As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain\nmarkets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.\nWe recently released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed\nto have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety\nincidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, may continue\nto result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users. Further\nunfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and\nbecomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could\nhave an amplified effect on our various platform offerings. Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates and\nCornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm\nto their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.\nOur brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain\ndivestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China, to our Yandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, and to Zomato in India, and while we have certain\ncontractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions,\nand consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us. Additionally, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we\nannounced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. Furthermore, if Drivers,\nmerchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the\nlaw, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result\nin harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently, our business.\nWhile we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a\ngood reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs,\nmaintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, and\nmedia strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their\nofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

We may not be able to manage our growth effectively,\nwhich could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.\nAs our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 32,600 global employees as of\nSeptember 30, 2022, of whom approximately 19,100 were located outside the United States. We expect the total number of our employees located outside the\nUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,\nincluding engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our new\nhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our\nexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions in\nworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductions\nin workforce. Any reduction in workforce or restructuring may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in\nworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult\nfor us to hire new employees in the future and increase the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in workforce. Properly\nmanaging our growth or any reductions in workforce will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could\nlikewise harm our business.\nOur failure to upgrade our technology or network infrastructure effectively to support our growth could result in unanticipated system disruptions, slow\nresponse times, or poor experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. To manage the growth of our operations and personnel and improve\nthe technology that supports our business operations, as well as our financial and management systems, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls\nover financial reporting, we will be required to commit substantial financial, operational, and technical resources. In particular, we will need to improve our\ntransaction processing and reporting, operational, and financial systems, procedures, and controls. For example, due to our significant growth, especially with\nrespect to our high-growth emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight, we face challenges in timely and appropriately designing controls in response to evolving\nrisks of material misstatement. These improvements are and will be particularly challenging when we acquire new businesses with different systems. Our current\nand planned personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations. If we are unable to expand our operations and hire\nadditional qualified personnel in an efficient manner, or if our operational technology is insufficient to reliably service Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or\nCarriers, platform user satisfaction will be adversely affected and may cause platform users to switch to our competitors\u2019 platforms, which would adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur organizational structure is complex and will continue to grow as we add additional Drivers, consumers, merchants, Carriers, Shippers, employees,\nproducts and offerings, and technologies, and as we continue to expand globally. We will need to improve our operational, financial, and management controls as\nwell as our reporting systems and procedures to support the growth of our organizational structure. We will require capital and management resources to grow and\nmature in these areas.

Furthermore, if consumers engage in criminal activity or misconduct while using our platform,\nDrivers and merchants may be unwilling to continue using our platform. In addition, certain regions where we operate have high rates of violent crime, which has\nimpacted Drivers and consumers in those regions. For example, in Latin America, there have been numerous and increasing reports of Drivers and consumers being\nvictimized by violent crime, such as armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while taking or providing a trip on our platform. If other criminal, inappropriate, or\nother negative incidents occur due to the conduct of platform users or third parties, our ability to attract platform users may be harmed, and our business and\nfinancial results could be adversely affected.\nPublic reporting or disclosure of reported safety information, including information about safety incidents reportedly occurring on or related to our platform,\nwhether generated by us or third parties such as media or regulators, may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers,\nor third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. On a smaller scale, we may face\nlitigation related to claims by Drivers for the actions of consumers or third parties. Furthermore, operating a motor vehicle is inherently dangerous. In addition, the\ngrowth of our Delivery offering has led to an increase in Couriers on two wheel vehicles such as scooters and bicycles, who are more vulnerable road users and\nface a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision than that faced while driving in a vehicle. For example, urban hazards such as unpaved or uneven\nroadways increase the risk and severity of potential injuries. In addition, Couriers, in particular those on two wheel vehicles predominantly in metropolitan areas,\nneed to share, navigate, and at times contend with narrow and heavily congested roads occupied by cars, buses and light rail, especially during \u201crush\u201d hours, all of\nwhich heighten the potential risk of injuries or death. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are\nexposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our\noperating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant\ncosts in investigating and defending against them. As we expand our products and offerings, such as Freight, this insurance risk will grow.\nWe are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently\nrisky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.\nWe have made substantial investments to develop new offerings and technologies, and we intend to continue investing significant resources in developing new\ntechnologies, tools, features, services, products and offerings. For example, through our acquisition of Cornershop, a provider of online grocery delivery in several\ncountries including Mexico and Chile, we expanded our Delivery offering to grocery delivery. Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,\nwhich operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol. In November 2021, our subsidiary\nUber Freight acquired Transplace, expanding Uber Freight\u2019s business through Transplace\u2019s expertise in transportation management. We also plan to invest\nsignificant resources to develop and expand new offerings and technologies in the markets in which Careem and Postmates operate.

Our growth strategy\nhas also included the divestment of certain lines of businesses in its entirety, and not just in certain jurisdictions, and instead partnering and investing in our\ncompetitors in those lines of businesses. As a result, a significant portion of our assets includes minority ownership positions, including in Didi, Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime, and Aurora.\nOur ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of\nDidi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the\nmanagement teams of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, our Yandex.Taxi joint venture, Lime and\nAurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions\nor take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies. Additionally, these companies have expanded their\nofferings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could\nenhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by\nsuch expansion into markets in which we operate.\nAny material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these\nassets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect\nsuch valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could\nadversely impact our financial results. These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies\nhave limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited\npublic information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular\neconomic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their business; are\ndomiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts\nof a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on\nthe relevant company\u2019s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive\npositions. For example, in light of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, members of our management team resigned from the board of our Yandex.Taxi joint\nventure, and we announced that we are actively looking for opportunities to accelerate the sale of our remaining holdings in the joint venture. The broader\nconsequences of this conflict, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions\nbetween the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict\u2019s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted.

Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would\nnot be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the\nrequirements of the Investment Company Act.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of\nfactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.\nFor Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and\ntypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certain\ncities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our\nrevenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal\nfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth of\nDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders.

We expect these seasonal trends to become more pronounced over time as our growth slows. Other seasonal trends\nmay develop or these existing seasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality,\nour operating results may fluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which\nwe operate, our ability to expand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth,\nour ability to keep pace with technological changes in the industries in which we operate, changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, harm\nto our brand or reputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating\nresults. We base our expense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant\nportion of our expenses and investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in\nlosses that exceed our expectations. If we are unable to achieve sustained profits, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of\nthe value of their investment.\nIf our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results\nand future prospects.\nOur Gross Bookings and revenue growth rates (in particular with respect to our ridesharing products) have slowed in recent periods, and we expect that they\nwill continue to slow in the future. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and\nour ability to:\n\u2022 grow supply and demand on our platform;\n\u2022 increase existing platform users\u2019 activity on our platform;\n\u2022 continue to introduce our platform to new markets;\n\u2022 provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;\n\u2022 expand our business and increase our market share and category position;\n\u2022 compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;\n\u2022 develop new products, offerings, and technologies;\n\u2022 identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;\n\u2022 penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;\n\u2022 reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public\ntransportation, which in many cases can be faster or cheaper than any other form of transportation;\n\u2022 maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;\n\u2022 enter or expand operations in some of the key countries in which we are currently limited by local regulations, such as Argentina, Germany, Italy,\nJapan, South Korea, and Spain; and\n\u2022 increase positive perception of our brand.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. In addition, circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our Delivery offering stemming\nfrom continued stay-at-home order demand related to COVID-19 may not continue in the future. A softening of Driver, consumer, merchant, Shipper, or Carrier\ndemand, whether caused by changes in the preferences of such parties, failure to maintain our brand, changes in the U.S. or global economies, licensing fees in\nvarious jurisdictions, competition, or other factors, may result in decreased revenue or growth and our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses, and if we cannot increase our revenue at a faster rate than the increase in our expenses, we will not\nachieve profitability.\nWe generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas and trips to and from airports. If our operations in large\nmetropolitan areas or ability to provide trips to and from airports are negatively affected, our financial results and future prospects would be adversely\nimpacted.\nIn 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Paulo\nin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentives\nand consumer discounts and promotions in these large metropolitan areas.

Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding\nepidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased\ncompetition, or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much\ngreater degree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas\nthat affect our ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to\nrenew existing licenses or do not receive new licenses in key metropolitan areas where we operate or such licenses are terminated, any inability to operate in such\nmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nFurther, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network is smaller and less liquid,\nthe cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetrating suburban and rural\nareas, or if we are unable to operate in certain key metropolitan areas in the future, our ability to serve what we consider to be our total addressable market would\nbe limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.\nIn 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. As a result of this concentration, our\noperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and from\nairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from\nairports. Sustained declines in air travel due to COVID-19, or other travel-related health concerns, could continue to suppress demand for airport-related Mobility\nand reduce our Mobility Gross Bookings from airport trips. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that\nridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations\naltogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such\nactions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers.\nAdditional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In\naddition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the\nnumber of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While we have entered into\nagreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airport boundaries, we cannot\nguarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similar agreements with airports\nin all jurisdictions.\nIf we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such\ntechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-\nautonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our\nplatform.

Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla,\nApple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car\nmanufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries.

Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicle\ntechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liability\nfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,\nand operating results.\nFederal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These\nregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,\nwe may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner to\noffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners could\nbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could\nadversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high\ndemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture and\nworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.\nOur employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we recently implemented our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,\nwhich includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges\nmaintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to conduct our business, increasing attrition or\nlimiting our ability to attract employees if individuals prefer to continue working full time at home or in the office. Prolonged remote work, as well as COVID-19\nmore generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balance and feelings of stress and\nsocial isolation, and we experienced higher levels of attrition. Future challenges related to our culture and workplace practices or additional negative publicity\ncould lead to further attrition and difficulty attracting high-quality employees.\nFuture leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior\nmanagement or other employee turnover. The loss of qualified executives and employees, or an inability to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality executives and\nemployees required for the planned expansion of our business, may harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow.\nIn addition, we depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi. We have\nentered into an employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi, which is at-will and has no specific duration. Recently hired executives may view our business\ndifferently than members of our prior management team and, over time, may make changes to our personnel and their responsibilities as well as our strategic focus,\noperations, or business plans. We may not be able to properly manage any such shift in focus, and any changes to our business may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn addition, our failure to put in place adequate succession plans for senior and key management roles or the failure of key employees to successfully transition\ninto new roles, for example, as a result of reductions in workforce, organizational changes and attrition, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating\nresults. The unexpected or abrupt departure of one or more of our key personnel and the failure to effectively transfer knowledge and effect smooth key personnel\ntransitions has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our business resulting from the loss of such person\u2019s skills, knowledge of our business, and\nyears of industry experience.

Individuals able to circumvent our security measures\nmay misappropriate confidential, proprietary, or personal information held by or on behalf of us, disrupt our operations, damage our computers, or otherwise\ndamage our business. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or mitigate the impact of any such breaches,\nincluding potential liability that may not be limited to the amounts covered by our insurance.\nSecurity breaches could also expose us to liability under various laws and regulations across jurisdictions and increase the risk of litigation and governmental\ninvestigation. We have been subject to security and privacy incidents in the past and may be again in the future. For example, in September 2022, we experienced a\ncybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed several internal systems; the investigation regarding this incident is ongoing. As an earlier example, in May 2014,\nwe experienced a data security incident in which an outside actor gained access to certain personal information belonging to Drivers through an access key written\ninto code that an employee had unintentionally posted publicly on a code-sharing website used by software developers (the \u201c2014 Breach\u201d). In October and\nNovember of 2016, outside actors downloaded the personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers worldwide (the \u201c2016 Breach\u201d). The accessed\ndata included the names, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, and drivers\u2019 license numbers of approximately 600,000 Drivers, among other information. For\nfurther information on this incident, see the risk factors titled \u201c\u2014We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information\nfrom the DOJ, state Attorney General (\u201cAG\u201d) offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business\u201d\nand \u201c\u2014We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines,\nlegislative, and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices,\u201d below. As we expand our operations, we may also assume\nliabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory\nauthorities that it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January\n14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident\nthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. In addition, in July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed\nthat it had been subject to a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform, and in November 2021 Drizly\nobtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in October 2022, the FTC announced a proposed order relating to the\ndata security incident. The proposed order will be available for public comment, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed order final. If\nDrizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court orders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any\nother data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

For\nexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information about\nrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to further\nstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.\nDeveloping and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and features\ndepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

Certain of our operational metrics are subject to\ninherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including key metrics such as MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position, with internal systems and tools,\nand our equity stakes in minority-owned affiliates with information provided by such minority-owned affiliates, that are not independently verified by any third\nparty and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which\nwe rely. Our internal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose, or our estimates of our category position. If the internal systems and tools we use to\ntrack these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these\nnumbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in\nmeasuring how our products are used across large populations globally. For example, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even though\nwe prohibit that in our Terms of Service and implement measures to detect and prevent that behavior. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we\nmeasure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term\nstrategies. If our operating metrics or our estimates of our category position or our equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates are not accurate representations of\nour business, or if investors do not perceive our operating metrics or estimates of our category position or equity stakes in our minority-owned affiliates to be\naccurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, our reputation may be significantly harmed, and our operating and financial results\ncould be adversely affected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and\nsafety concerns. If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or other\nadverse financial and accounting consequences.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allow\nconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).\nIn 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase in the future, particularly in the markets in\nwhich Careem operates. The use of cash in connection with our technology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many\njurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash for ridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply\nwith these regulations could result in the imposition of significant fines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those\njurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use of cash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for\nDrivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent or fatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety\nincidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers while using our platform have been reported.

Cyberattacks that leverage computer malware, ransomware,\nviruses, denial of service attacks, spamming, phishing, and social engineering have become more prevalent, have occurred on our systems in the past, and may\noccur on our systems in the future. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and employing more sophisticated attack techniques. Our detection capabilities may not be\nsufficient to prevent or detect a sophisticated cyberattacker, such as a nation state using a zero day exploit or unknown malware. Breaches of our facilities, network,\napplications, identity management solutions or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and platforms, impair our ability to protect data, compromise\nconfidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets,\nrequire us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our reputation, business and operating results. In addition, our increase\nin hybrid and remote working arrangements may heighten the foregoing risks.\nVarious other factors may also cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, inadequate or ineffective redundancy,\nissues with upgrading or creating new systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors by our employees or third-party service providers, or\nbreaches in the security of these systems or platforms. For example, fraudsters may attempt to induce employees or platform users to disclose information to gain\naccess to our data or the data of platform users. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective\nmanner, they could result in adverse impacts to our business operations and our financial results. Because of our prominence, the number of platform users, and the\ntypes and volume of personal data on our systems, we may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Although we have developed, and continue to\ndevelop, systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and that of platform users, and to prevent data loss, undesirable activities on our platform, and\nsecurity breaches, we cannot guarantee that such measures will provide absolute security.

In addition, our growing use of artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) (including machine learning) in\nour offerings presents additional risks. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information.\nInappropriate or controversial data practices by us or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits and regulatory investigations.\nThese deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to\ncompetitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.\nWe are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely\nimpacted.\nWe face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include the risk of market shifts toward electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) and lower carbon\nbusiness models and risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency, severity and duration\nof extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our third-party\nsuppliers, and the business of merchants, Shippers, Carriers and Drivers using our platform, and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to\nmaintain or resume operations. Additionally, we are subject to emerging climate policies such as a regulation adopted in California in May 2021 requiring 90% of\nvehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in zero emission vehicles by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. In addition, Drivers\nmay be subject to climate-related policies that indirectly impact our business, such as the Congestion Charge Zone and Ultra Low Emission Zone schemes adopted\nin London that impose fees on drivers in fossil-fueled vehicles, which may impact our ability to attract and maintain Drivers on our platform, and to the extent we\nexperience Driver supply constraints in a given market, we may need to increase Driver incentives.\nWe have made climate related commitments that require us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time and circumstances may arise,\nincluding those beyond our control, that may require us to revise the contemplated timeframes for implementing these commitments.\nWe have made climate related commitments, including our commitment to 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025, our commitment to net\nzero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030, and our commitment to be a net zero company by 2040. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets\nenvironmental standards for our supply chain, and we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. Progressing towards\nour climate commitments requires us to invest significant effort, resources, and management time, and circumstances may arise, including those beyond our\ncontrol, that may require us to revise our timelines and/or climate commitments. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our ability to\ndedicate resources to make the progress on our climate commitments that we initially anticipated. In addition, our ability to meet our climate commitments is\ndependent on external factors such as rapidly changing regulations, policies and related interpretation, advances in technology such as battery storage, as well the\navailability, cost and accessibility of EVs to Drivers, and the availability of EV charging infrastructure that can be efficiently accessed by Drivers.

In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we do\nnot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,\nand results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business and financial results\nwill depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak and any future \u201cwaves\u201d or resurgences of the outbreak or variants\nof the virus, both globally and within the United States, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, the impact on\ncapital and financial markets, the impact on global supply chains, foreign currencies exchange, governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business and\nwhether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behaviors, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the impact the COVID-19 pandemic or any future outbreak of a disease will have on our business partners and third-party\nvendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. Additionally, concerns over the\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price\nand our ability to access capital markets. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of\nheightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the pandemic that are not\ncurrently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on\ndiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions,\nincluding slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary\nperiods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point\nproducts over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or\nmay reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend\nto be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally\nconsidered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in\nour network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could\nharm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for\nwork, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.\nIncreases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.\nFactors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used\nvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may\ncontinue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5265, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d51c855-df59-43b7-9f95-eadf0bb058c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d51c855-df59-43b7-9f95-eadf0bb058c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "938ed57f-6c1c-44f0-820e-25ca4d762c12", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "a95de75919b01c3403f6978b23e0b9be386c63da809b4a884b126b60591a3f9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26fd0615-beec-490d-87ed-278baab38881", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "a54de58dc6351427d2fb5d916f39c746098633d3809e24fbf84ce1ca1f01d4ab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15594649-d2a4-4ccb-809f-bc3b550f0450", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a96a5f820e6111243b37312b92e7aa898d9fa147cecf626fd87f67999975bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bcffcf454cb1df0b10f0a659db50ad7f434bb85751c39965d74b320985647035", "text": "If spending at many of the merchants in\nour network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could\nharm our business and operating results.

If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt\nto access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and\nmay use our competitors\u2019 products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications\noperators.

We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces\nwill not charge us fees to list our applications for download. For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users\u2019 permission to track their activities across\nthird-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of\nsuch advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our\nplatform.

We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is\npossible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not\nprovide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may\nbe required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely\naffect our business.\nOur business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our\nplatform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS and Android.

If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the\ntransition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services\nfrom these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.\nWe use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical\noperation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data\ncenters may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct.

Our\nsystems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service\nproviders to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require\nus to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service. This could be time consuming and costly and may result in the loss of\ndata, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch\nto another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center\nproviders are subject to the same risks. Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities\nhave no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is\narranged. Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services\nthrough our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential\nDrivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable.

If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution,\nand any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt\ninstruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and\nother financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our\nexisting debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing\non favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support\nour business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.\nWe have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness.

In particular, we may need\nto incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce\nthe funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working\ncapital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our\nvulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and\nthe industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow\nfrom operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to\nfund our operations.

If we prevail in the\nproceedings for which a pay-to-play payment was made, the jurisdiction collecting the payment will be required to repay such amounts and also may be required to\npay interest.\nAdditionally, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate have in the past, and may in the future, examine or challenge our methodologies for\nvaluing developed technology, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and operating results. Furthermore, our future\nincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, or changes in tax laws,\nregulations, or accounting principles.

In addition, in connection with any planned or future acquisitions, we may acquire businesses that have differing\nlicenses and other arrangements that may be challenged by tax authorities for not being at arm\u2019s-length or that are otherwise potentially less tax efficient than our\nlicenses and arrangements. Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certain\njurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financial\nstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted on December 22, 2017,\nand modified in 2020, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. The legislation and\nregulations promulgated in connection therewith remain unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well\nas interpretations and incremental implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d), any of which could lessen or\nincrease certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and\nlocal taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. Beginning on January 1, 2022, the Act\neliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures in the current period and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize these expenses.\nAlthough Congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement, there is no assurance that the provision will be\nrepealed or otherwise modified.

If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforward amounts generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will begin to expire in 2031, and the state net operating loss carryforward amounts of $10.2 billion will begin to expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2021,\nwe also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $11.1 billion, of which $507 million will begin to expire in 2023. Realization of these net operating loss\ncarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the IRC, if a corporation\nundergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s\nability to use its pre-ownership change U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-ownership change U.S. federal tax attributes, such as research\ntax credits, to offset its post-ownership change income may be limited. Many U.S. states follow similar rules for restricting use of tax attributes after an ownership\nchange. We may experience ownership changes in the future because of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our\nability to use our pre-ownership change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income may be subject to\nlimitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated\nfinancial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization, operating expenses, other income and expense, and assets and liabilities, when translated, may also vary materially and thus affect\nour overall financial results. We have not to date, but may in the future, enter into hedging arrangements to manage foreign currency translation, but such activity\nmay not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results due to currency exchange rate changes. Hedging arrangements are inherently risky, and we have\nlimited experience establishing hedging programs, which could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating\nresults.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we\nacquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, divest\nportions or aspects of our business, sell minority stakes in portions or aspects of our business, and acquire complementary companies or technologies, including our\nYandex.Taxi joint venture in Russia/CIS, our joint venture with an affiliate of SK Telecom Co., Ltd., and our acquisitions of Careem, Cornershop, Postmates,\nDrizly and Transplace.

For example,\nwith respect to the integration of Careem and Drizly, each company\u2019s brand, product app(s) and payments apps continue to operate in parallel with Uber\u2019s apps and\neach company\u2019s engineering, human resources, and operations teams will continue to operate independently and report to such company\u2019s own Chief Executive\nOfficer. Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisition and our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or\nreputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.\nIn addition, our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other similar laws outside the United\nStates. Our existing and planned safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage corrupt practices by such parties, may not prove effective,\nand such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible.\nWe may not receive a favorable return on investment for prior or future business combinations, and we cannot predict whether these transactions will be\naccretive to the value of our common stock. It is also possible that acquisitions, combinations, divestitures, joint ventures, or other strategic transactions we\nannounce could be viewed negatively by the press, investors, platform users, or regulators, any or all of which may adversely affect our reputation and our\nbusiness. Any of these factors may adversely affect our ability to consummate a transaction, our financial condition, and our operating results.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our\nbusiness model in those jurisdictions as a result.\nIn certain jurisdictions, including expansion markets such as Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, our ridesharing business model has\nbeen blocked, capped, or suspended, or we have been required to change our business model, due primarily to laws and significant regulatory restrictions in such\njurisdictions. In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirements\nor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. We cannot predict whether future regulatory decisions or\nlegislation in other jurisdictions may embolden or encourage other authorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an\nexisting license or permit.\nTraditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require us\nto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January\n2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could be\npicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission\nimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in\nNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform.

In August 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to\nenact a new \u201ccruising cap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of\nNew York City. Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains.\nAdditionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such\nsurcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip\ntaken in Chicago. In addition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went\ninto effect on January 1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage\nrequirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being\nconsidered or have been enacted in countries outside the United States. If other jurisdictions impose similar regulations, our business growth could be adversely\naffected.\nIn certain jurisdictions, we are subject to national, state, local, or municipal laws and regulations that are ambiguous in their application or enforcement or that\nwe believe are invalid or inapplicable. In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to cease\noperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that our\nbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers who used\nthe Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legal\nchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact our\nfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruled\nthat we violated local competition laws. In response, we appealed the decision, made certain changes to our Mobility products in Colombia and re-launched\nMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, in\ncertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products and\nofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision to\ncontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of this\npractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that our\nlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the future\ncontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decision\nas a gesture of goodwill to pay the fines on behalf of Drivers or to pay Drivers\u2019 defense costs, which, in the aggregate, can be in the millions of dollars.\nFurthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and could\nadversely affect our revenue.

We are subject to differing, and\nsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings. A large number of proposals are before various national,\nregional, and local legislative bodies and regulatory entities, both within the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business\nmodel.

We cannot predict whether or when such proposals may be\nadopted.\nFurther, existing or new laws and regulations could expose us to substantial liability, including significant expenses necessary to comply with such laws and\nregulations, and could dampen the growth and usage of our platform. For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency medical\ntransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations.

We are actively challenging some of these laws and regulations and are lobbying other jurisdictions to oppose similar restrictions on our business,\nespecially our ridesharing services. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or\ngovernmental actions seeking to curb air pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and\nimprove air quality in the city (including the institution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an\n\u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effect in April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and\nplan to help Drivers on our platform fully transition to electric vehicles by 2025. Moreover, in May 2021, California adopted a regulation requiring 90% of vehicle\nmiles traveled by rideshare fleets in California to have been in EVs by 2030, with interim targets beginning in 2023. Additionally, proposed ridesharing regulations\nin Egypt and other jurisdictions may require us to share certain personal data with government authorities to operate our app, which we may not be willing to\nprovide. Our failure to share such data in accordance with these regulations may result in government authorities assessing significant fines or penalties against us\nor shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app in Egypt on either a temporary or indefinite basis.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom exited from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), an event commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK\nrepresented approximately 8.1% of our global Mobility Gross Bookings during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nIn addition, we are currently involved in litigation in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We initiated some of these legal challenges to contest\nthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platform\nusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws related\nto, among other things, transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, fee calculations, personal injuries, privacy, intellectual property, product\nliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the Supreme Court\nof Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regions of\nAustralia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.\nThese legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in\nfinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, which\ncould harm our ability to operate our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business,\nrevenue, and operating results.\nIn addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access to\ndockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our other\nMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. The\noccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negative\npublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCompetition authorities closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign antitrust and competition laws.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4667, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51d7b6b8-c2d2-41b5-82a9-782e74033bdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "51d7b6b8-c2d2-41b5-82a9-782e74033bdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54749a74-7592-4c14-b345-fe14bad790c3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "992d44d3d8a92fc7e755381e07441a6e62ef16f6b9f553c5257b1290ed444be3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f49b0aa3-a6e3-4cb7-8bca-456afe39322e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "78ba9e6a4c8aca172362f2230f2794d7c72dd496601ed3341030ff03669d47c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0ec6109-7e69-40a5-9668-b482ca891edd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "372de558c7f3cf700d33359de942c8d3514b3bb76c08f5333b96bc0c398fa842", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e837e52708310028c3d850f39644e6ee6978519b6196f9c6dad259323780bd9b", "text": "For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collision\nthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters.

An increasing number of governments are enforcing\ncompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularly\nsurrounding issues of pricing parity, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of\nanti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices are too\nhigh (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions on our\nbusiness, other jurisdictions may follow. Further, any new requirements or restrictions, or proposed requirements or restrictions, could result in adverse publicity or\nfines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.\nIn addition, governmental agencies and regulators may, among other things, prohibit future acquisitions, divestitures, or combinations we plan to make, impose\nsignificant fines or penalties, require divestiture of certain of our assets, or impose other restrictions that limit or require us to modify our operations, including\nlimitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models. Such rulings may alter the way in which we do business and,\ntherefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\noperating results.\nWe expect that the U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies (e.g., the DOJ and the FTC) will continue to closely scrutinize merger activity, with a particular focus\non the technology sector, and there can be no assurance that proposed, completed or future mergers, acquisitions and divestitures will not be the subject of an\ninvestigation or enforcement action by the DOJ or the FTC.\n82", "start_char_idx": 3829, "end_char_idx": 6650, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ec6109-7e69-40a5-9668-b482ca891edd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ec6109-7e69-40a5-9668-b482ca891edd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "634e78b8-19e4-4d90-b3ca-c48fe8e49948", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "2863c6a994e684aba98e539d931c7320eac2597d1ea06a859d787057ef8172cc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "51d7b6b8-c2d2-41b5-82a9-782e74033bdb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "83", "file_name": "uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/10q/uber_10q_sept_2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1178622, "creation_date": "2023-12-22", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-22", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-22"}, "hash": "e837e52708310028c3d850f39644e6ee6978519b6196f9c6dad259323780bd9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a19ad3e-498f-4be1-929f-03b171c06973", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29e9d8a20a4ec5a8f8ca47d23094ae0aba7801b97a590526f7d697315b9d3ed0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "372de558c7f3cf700d33359de942c8d3514b3bb76c08f5333b96bc0c398fa842", "text": "Changes in antitrust laws globally, or in their interpretation, administration or enforcement, may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures, operations and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.\nMost jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that\ncertain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions. For example, our\nsubsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money\ninstitution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money\nremittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands. In addition, Uber\nPayments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. We\ncontinue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support\nthe future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business\noperations before being granted such licenses. If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or\nlimit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other\nenforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses. In some countries, it is not clear whether we are\nrequired to be licensed as a payment services provider. Were local regulators to determine that such arrangements require us to be so licensed, such regulators may\nblock payments to Drivers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and\ninvolve substantial delay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nStarting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to\nStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate\neach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our\nplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our\nplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,\nand prospects. Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not\ncompleting all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received\nby those users. A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nIn addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment\nprocessing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.

Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to, our business practices, such as\nfees, pricing, and related disclosures, relationships with third parties, and data privacy and security incidents. For example, in September 2018, after investigations\nand various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with the Attorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated\njudgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related to our failure to report the incident for approximately one year. In April 2018, we entered\ninto a consent decree that lasts through 2038 covering the 2014 Breach and the 2016 Breach with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d), which the FTC\nCommissioners approved in October 2018. In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French regulators imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million\nrelated to the 2016 Breach. In addition, in July 2022, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ concerning its investigation into our handling of\nthe 2016 Breach. The 2016 Breach has led to, and it, as well as other security incidents we experience, may continue to lead to, costly and time-consuming\nregulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international\nregulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued a proposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain\ninformation, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US Safety Report. We negotiated the total payment to $9.15 million\n($150,000 as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021. Investigations and enforcement actions from\nsuch entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users\u2019 trust, could severely disrupt our business.

Any such determinations could also result in significant adverse publicity or additional\nreputational harm, and could result in or complicate other inquiries, investigations, or lawsuits from other regulators in future merger control or conduct\ninvestigations.

For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security incident\nthat allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of\nthis or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand,\nbusiness disruption, and significant liabilities.

Moreover, in October 2022, the FTC announced a proposed order relating to the data security incident. The proposed order will be available for\npublic comment, after which the FTC will decide whether to make the proposed order final. If Drizly becomes subject to additional liability or regulatory or court\norders as a result of this or other data security incidents or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident that Drizly or we experience, we may face\nharm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not\nbe adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and\ninternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy\nand security. The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for\ncontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use of\npersonal data, strengthened individual data rights, data breach requirements, limitations on data retention, strengthened requirements for special categories of\npersonal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data, and additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data. The\nGDPR further provides that EU member states may institute additional laws and regulations impacting the processing of personal data, including (i) special\ncategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automated\nindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs and\nharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significant\npenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Other\njurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costs\nand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers and\nnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action\nagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.\nstates have adopted, and likely will continue to adopt, similar laws that provide new consumer privacy rights and business operational requirements.

Further, these proceedings and any subsequent\nadverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.

We are\nsubject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers\u2019 tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, intellectual\nproperty infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, and employment and human resources practices. The results of any such\nlitigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time\nconsuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal\nproceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to\nchange the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nIn addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process\nfor all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become\nmore costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to\nour reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future\nvoluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our\nlitigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by\nplatform users and employees.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules\nbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of\nprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we\ncould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly\nlawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.\nWe have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,\ninvestigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.\nWe have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition,\nit is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the\nmaximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new\nvehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth\nprospects would be adversely impacted.\nWe may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.\nWe operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract\nDrivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual\nplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages\nfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,\nwe settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. In\nconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to\ndefend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative\npublicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these\npractices.\nOur business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance\ncarriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects\nof our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.\nWe use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our\nMobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist\ncoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on a\nlimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot\nguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other\nautomobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general\nliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner\nunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and\nCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant\nadditional costs.\nIn addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the\nrisk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our\ninsurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition. Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by\nus through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms.

Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance\nrequirements with respect to ridesharing. Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with\nrespect to ridesharing.

Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations\nrelating to insurance coverage could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, have\nbeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculate\nconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.\nFurther, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.\nAdditional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been the\nsubject of litigation and regulatory inquiries related to, among other things, the calculation of and statements regarding consumer fares and Driver earnings\n(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters. In addition, an increasing number of\nmunicipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surge pricing with respect to our Mobility offering.

Further, certain adverse\noutcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.\nWe may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially\nreasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses.\nWe may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and\nexpense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing\naspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results\ncould harm our operating results.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles.\nThe accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business\nmodel, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules,\nregulations, and interpretations, of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial\nstatements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in\nmaterially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting\ncontrols.\nIf we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which \u201cinvestment companies\u201d are permitted to conduct their\nbusiness activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the\nInvestment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute\ninvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as minority-owned affiliates, we believe\nthat we are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an\ninvestment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with restrictions imposed by the\nInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would have\nan adverse effect on our financial condition.
